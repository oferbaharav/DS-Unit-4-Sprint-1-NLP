    " - Try different visualizations for words and frequencies - what story do you want to tell with the data?\n",

    " - Try and identify requirements for experience specific technologies that are asked for in the job listings. How are those distributed among the job listings?\n",
    " - Use a clustering algorithm to cluster documents by their most important terms. Do the clusters reveal any common themes?\n",
